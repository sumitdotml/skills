# tinygrad

Deep learning framework development with tinygrad - a minimal tensor library with autograd, JIT compilation, and multi-device support. Use when writing neural networks, training models, implementing tensor operations, working with UOps/PatternMatcher for graph transformations, or contributing to tinygrad internals. Triggers on tinygrad imports, Tensor operations, nn modules, optimizer usage, schedule/codegen work, or device backends.

```bash
